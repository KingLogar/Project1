SRC Folder Breakdown

The following is an analysis of all the files and folders in
the root of the SRC directory.

------------------------------------------------------------

- The first sub-folder in SRC is the DOC folder, short for
  Documentation.  Simply put, this folder is where you put
  all files related to the documentation of the template.
- The second sub-folder is the IMG folder, which is short for
  image.  As you may have guess, any assets having to do with
  images are stored here.
- The final sub-folder we have in SRC is JS, which stands for 
  JavaScript.  This is where all JavaScript files and assets 
  are stored.
- The first file we have in src is .EditorConfig.  This file
  is used to maintain consistent text formatting in collaborative
  projects.  The file is simply a list of settings to be used 
  by each coder's IDE.
- The next file we have is the .GitAttributes file.  This file
  is created and used by the Git VCS.  This file lists off if
  each file extension in the project will be converted to a 
  text format or left as binary.
- Next we have the .GitIgnore file.  This is another file used
  by Git.  As the name would suggest, the .GitIgnore file lists
  the files and/or directories that are to be left untracked
  by Git.  Useful if you have a todo list or other non-critical
  files.
- The next file we have is the first one that is used in the actual
  web template.  404.html is a standard 404 page, used when a user 
  tries to access a page that doesn't exist (usually as a result of
  broken links).
- BrowserConfig.xml is a file that's only used under certain 
  circumstances, specifically if the page is accessed using 
  Internet Explorer 11 running on Windows 8.  In that case it
  is used to create the background images and colors of the page
  but is otherwise optional.
- FavIcon.ico has two traditional uses.  The first is as the 
  small icon that appears next to the site in your bookmarks 
  list.  The second use is almost identical, except that instead
  of appearing in your bookmarks list it appears in the address bar/tab 
  header of your browser.
- Humans.txt is a short file designed to give proper credits to
  the team responsible for the project.  All they need to do is 
  put their names and roles in the file.
- Icon.png is a slightly larger version of favicon.ico, and is 
  used as an alternative when favicon is too small to properly
  resize.
- Index.html is the default landing page for the website, and 
  most likely the first page the user will see.  A more detailed
  explanation of this file will be included in the next section.
