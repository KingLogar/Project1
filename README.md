SRC Folder Breakdown

The following is an analysis of all the files and folders in
the root of the SRC directory.

------------------------------------------------------------

- The first sub-folder in SRC is the DOC folder, short for
  Documentation.  Simply put, this folder is where you put
  all files related to the documentation of the template.
- The second sub-folder is the IMG folder, which is short for
  image.  As you may have guess, any assets having to do with
  images are stored here.
- The final sub-folder we have in SRC is JS, which stands for 
  JavaScript.  This is where all JavaScript files and assets 
  are stored.
- The first file we have in src is .EditorConfig.  This file
  is used to maintain consistent text formatting in collaborative
  projects.  The file is simply a list of settings to be used 
  by each coder's IDE.
- The next file we have is the .GitAttributes file.  This file
  is created and used by the Git VCS.  This file lists off if
  each file extension in the project will be converted to a 
  text format or left as binary.
- Next we have the .GitIgnore file.  This is another file used
  by Git.  As the name would suggest, the .GitIgnore file lists
  the files and/or directories that are to be left untracked
  by Git. Useful if you have a todo list in the project.
