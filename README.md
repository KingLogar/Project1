SRC Folder Breakdown

The following is an analysis of all the files and folders in
the root of the SRC directory.

------------------------------------------------------------

- The first sub-folder in SRC is the DOC folder, short for
  Documentation.  Simply put, this folder is where you put
  all files related to the documentation of the template.
- The second sub-folder is the IMG folder, which is short for
  image.  As you may have guess, any assets having to do with
  images are stored here.
- The final sub-folder we have in SRC is JS, which stands for 
  JavaScript.  This is where all JavaScript files and assets 
  are stored.
